# Project Title: Bankruptcy Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict corporate bankruptcy using financial and market data. The dataset combines firm-level financial metrics, market data, and bankruptcy events to build a predictive model that classifies companies as likely to default or remain solvent.

## Data Sources
The data is derived from multiple sources:
- **Compustat**: Provides financial information, including balance sheets and income statements.
- **CRSP**: Contains daily stock market data, such as prices and returns.
- **LoPucki Bankruptcy Database**: Offers detailed bankruptcy filing records, including type and filing dates.
